# Prodigy InfoTech Internship - Task 3

## Building a Decision Tree Regressor for Mortgage Denial Prediction

### Overview
In this project, I completed Task 3 of my internship at Prodigy Infotech, which involved building a decision tree regressor to predict the percentage of mortgage denials based on demographic and geographical data. The dataset used for this task is the "Time_Series_Mortgage_Denials_By_Race" dataset.

### Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Time_Series_Mortgage_Denials_By_Race
- **Source:** Search by me on Mortages. 
- **Description:** This dataset contains information about mortgage denials, including demographic attributes such as race and geographical information.

### Data Preprocessing and Analysis
- Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Checked for multicollinearity among features.
- Handled outliers if present.

### Model Building and Evaluation
- Built a Decision Tree Regressor model.
- Trained the model using the training data.
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared metrics.
- Visualized the decision tree to understand the model's decision-making process.

### Results
- The Decision Tree Regressor model achieved [insert performance metrics here].
- The decision tree visualization provides insights into the factors influencing mortgage denials.

### Conclusion
This project equipped me with valuable experience in building and evaluating decision tree regressor models for predictive modeling tasks. I'm excited to apply these skills to real-world scenarios in my future projects.
